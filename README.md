## Intro-to-Generative-AI
introduction of Generative and details 
## 1. Generative AI
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of generating new data or content, such as text, images, audio, or code. It typically works using machine learning models like neural networks trained on large datasets.

## Types of Generative AI:
**Text Generation:** Models like GPT produce coherent text for chatbots, storytelling, etc.

**Image Generation:** Models like DALL·E and Stable Diffusion create or modify images.

**Code Generation:** Codex generates programming code.

**Audio Generation:** Models like Jukebox create music or voice synthesis.

**Video Generation:** Early-stage models generate or edit video content.

## 2. Large Language & Multi-Modal Models
**Large Language Models (LLMs):** These are trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Bard, and Meta’s LLaMA.

**Multi-Modal Models:** These process and generate multiple types of data, like text, images, and audio. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Gemini AI by Google can handle text and images simultaneously.

## 3. Limitations of Generative AI & Strategies to Overcome Them
## Limitations:
**Accuracy Issues:** Generated content might include hallucinations or factual inaccuracies.

**Bias:** Reflects biases in the training data.

**Context Limitations:** Struggles with long or complex multi-step tasks.

**Lack of Real-Time Knowledge:** Often lacks up-to-date or specific information.

**Ethical Concerns:** Risks include plagiarism, spreading misinformation, and malicious use.

## Strategies to Overcome Them:
**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Combines LLMs with external data sources to ensure accuracy.

**Fine-Tuning:** Training the model on domain-specific data to reduce biases and improve relevance.

**Grounding:** Integrating real-time tools like search engines or databases to validate responses.

**Explainability:** Enhancing models to clarify their reasoning processes.

## 4. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG enhances generative AI by incorporating retrieval mechanisms. When faced with a query, it retrieves relevant documents or facts from a database, then uses this information to generate accurate responses. This approach combines the benefits of generative capabilities with factual reliability.

## 5. Core Concepts:
**Text Embeddings:** Numeric representations of text in vector form, capturing semantic meaning. Used for tasks like similarity searches or clustering.

**Cosine Similarity:** A metric to measure the similarity between two vectors (texts). The higher the cosine value (up to 1), the more similar the two texts are.

**Vector Database:** Stores and retrieves embeddings efficiently. Examples include Pinecone, Weaviate, and Milvus.

**Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts to improve the quality and relevance of responses generated by AI.

## 6. New Models of Gemini AI
Google’s Gemini AI suite includes multi-modal capabilities, integrating text and image processing. Gemini 1, recently launched, focuses on:
Complex reasoning.

Real-time search integration.

Coding and conversational proficiency. Future versions may incorporate enhanced multimodal interaction and interconnectivity with external systems.

## 7. Function Calling Modes & Supported Models
**Function Calling:** Enables models like OpenAI's GPT to interact with external tools (APIs, databases, etc.) to perform specific actions or retrieve information.
Examples: Retrieving weather data, booking appointments, running calculations.

**Supported Models:** GPT-4-turbo, Gemini AI (with grounding capabilities).

## 8. Grounding With Google Search
Grounding integrates real-time search into AI systems to provide factual, updated information. It resolves inaccuracies by fetching and validating data from authoritative sources during the query process.

## 9. Agent Builders and Code Interpreters
**Agent Builders:** Platforms or frameworks (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI Functions) to create AI agents that interact with users or perform multi-step tasks, using tools, APIs, or retrieval methods.

**Code Interpreters:** Enable AI to analyze, execute, and debug code dynamically. Useful for data analysis, solving technical queries, and automating repetitive tasks.
